    <h1>Last Christmas</h1>
        <p>
            Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
            But the very next day you gave it away<br>
            This year, to save me from tears<br>
            I'll give it to someone special<br>
            <br>
            Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
            But the very next day you gave it away<br>

            I'll give it to someone special<br>
            <br>
            Once bitten and twice shy<br>
            I keep my distance, but you still catch my eye<br>
            Tell me baby, do you recognize me?<br>
            Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me<br>
            <br>
            Happy Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it<br>
            With a note saying "I love you", I meant it<br>
            Now I know what a fool I've been<br>
            But if you kissed me now, I know you'd fool me again<br>
            <br>
            Last Christmas I gave you my heart<br>
            But the very next day you gave it away<br>

            I'll give it to someone special<br>
